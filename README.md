# Realsense-Object-Detection-Public
I'm currently using a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Google Coral usb accelerator to run object detection on a Intel Realsense 435i. As of right now im running Mobilenet_SSD_V2 but will begin to experiment with different models. This set up is running somewhere around 25 FPS, but if you implement a graphical depth map along with it it drops to around 8 FPS. I will publish the alligned depth map code once I get a chance to clean it up.

If you have any suggestions or things that you would like to see out of this feature wise please feel free to let me know.
