# Realsense-Object-Detection-Public
I'm currently using a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Google Coral usb accelerator to run object detection on a Intel Realsense 435i. As of right now im running Mobilenet_SSD_V2 but will begin to experiment with different models. With my current setup Realsense_Object_Detection.py is running ~25 fps, but realsense_object_detection_allign is running ~20 fps with the depth map disabled and ~8 fps with it enabled. Code optimization needs to be explored.

If you have any suggestions or things that you would like to see out of this feature wise please feel free to let me know.
